# 🤖 FREE LLM Integration Setup Instructions

Your chat API has been updated to use **Hugging Face's FREE AI models**! Here's how to complete the setup:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Hugging Face SDK installed (`@huggingface/inference`)
- ✅ Chat API updated to use **SmolLM3-3B** (state-of-the-art 3B model!)
- ✅ AI responses will use your project's name, AI name, and description
- ✅ Optimized for natural conversations and customer service
- ✅ Fallback responses in case of errors

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Get Your FREE Hugging Face Token

1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join) and create a **FREE** account
2. Go to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Click "New token"
4. Give it a name like "SiteKick Chat"
5. Select "Read" permission (free tier)
6. Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root with:

```bash
# Add this to your .env.local file
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here

# If you don't have these yet, add them too:
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### 3. Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
bun dev
```

## 🎉 That's It!

Your chat widget will now:

- Use real AI powered by Microsoft's DialoGPT model
- Respond as the AI name you set for each project
- Include context about your project name and description
- Fallback to smart responses if the AI is unavailable

## 💡 How It Works

Your chat now uses **SmolLM3-3B**, a cutting-edge 3B parameter model that:

- ✨ **Converses naturally** like a real human customer service rep
- 🎯 **Understands context** from your project's description
- 🌍 **Supports 6 languages** (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese)
- 🚀 **Optimized for business chat** with professional, helpful responses

The AI will introduce itself using:

- **AI Name**: The name you set for each project
- **Project Name**: Your project's name
- **Description**: The project description you provided

Example: If your project is called "Acme Corp" with AI name "Sarah" and description "We sell amazing widgets", the AI will say:

> "Hi! I'm Sarah from Acme Corp. We sell amazing widgets. How can I help you today?"

## 🆓 Cost Information

- **Hugging Face**: Completely FREE (with rate limits)
- **Your existing setup**: No additional costs
- **Vercel hosting**: Still free tier compatible

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Set up the Hugging Face token (5 minutes)
2. Test your chat widget
3. Customize project descriptions for better AI responses
4. Optional: Monitor usage in Hugging Face dashboard

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Chat not working?**
